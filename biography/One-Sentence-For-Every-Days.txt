I was born in 1993 February 21, Sunday.
Now I decided to write something for every day I was alive.
I am now 29 years, eleven months and eleven days old.
10,938 days have passed since my birth.
Today is 2023 February 2, Thursday.
Iran time is 18:16.
I decided to write, so I write 10,938 lines...!
I had a talent that I always ignored.
It was sculpture.
And I never regretted it.
But I am proud to have discovered it.
Because I can make a sculpture with my eyes closed!!!
I failed in love but fell in love again.
It took me 10 years to be able to write with both hands.
If genius is sheer effort, I'll be a genius.
